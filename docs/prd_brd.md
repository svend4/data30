# PRD/BRD: Data30 Requirements Document

## Document Control
- **Document ID:** PRD-BRD-DATA30
- **Version:** 0.1
- **Status:** Draft
- **Owner:** Product Team
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-28
- **Document Link:** `docs/prd_brd.md`

## Goals
- Define a single, agreed-upon source of truth for product and business requirements.
- Align stakeholders on scope, success metrics, and delivery boundaries.
- Ensure traceability from requirements to business goals and measurable outcomes.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Requirements capture for the initial release (MVP).
- Stakeholder alignment on goals, metrics, and acceptance criteria.
- Documentation of risks, assumptions, and constraints.

### Out of Scope
- Post-MVP enhancements or roadmap items.
- Implementation details (architecture, infrastructure decisions).
- Vendor selection or procurement activities.

## User Stories
- **As a Product Manager**, I want a consolidated PRD/BRD so that requirements are clear and stakeholders align on priorities.
- **As a Business Owner**, I want success metrics linked to requirements so that ROI and impact are measurable.
- **As a Delivery Lead**, I want constraints and risks documented so that planning accounts for known limitations.
- **As a QA Lead**, I want traceability so that test plans can map to business objectives.

## Constraints
- Delivery timeline: MVP within the current quarter.
- Budget: Fixed allocation for the MVP release.
- Compliance: Must adhere to applicable data privacy requirements.
- Resources: Limited engineering capacity; parallel initiatives in progress.

## Risks
- **Scope creep:** Uncontrolled requirement changes could delay delivery.
- **Dependency delays:** External integrations may slip timelines.
- **Resource constraints:** Competing priorities could reduce delivery capacity.
- **Stakeholder misalignment:** Lack of clear approvals could cause rework.

## Assumptions
- Key stakeholders are available for timely reviews and approvals.
- Required data sources and APIs are accessible and stable.
- MVP scope is acceptable to stakeholders for initial launch.
