# Project Timeline

> Fill in the duration estimates (in working days), risk criticality, and baseline start date.
> The schedule fields will then be calculated accordingly.

## Assumptions
- Working calendar: 5-day work week.
- Buffers are added to each stage as a separate line item (not merged into the base estimate).
- Dates should be adjusted after approvals/inputs are available.

## Stage Plan

| Stage | Base estimate (days) | Risk criticality (Low/Med/High) | Risk buffer (days) | Dependencies | Critical path | Start date | End date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Discovery & scope | 10 | Low | 2 | None | TBD | TBD | TBD | Buffer 15% |
| 2. Requirements & solution design | 17 | Medium | 4 | 1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Buffer 20% |
| 3. Implementation | 36 | High | 11 | 2 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Buffer 30% |
| 4. QA & validation | 17 | Medium | 4 | 3 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Buffer 25% |
| 5. Release & handover | 8 | High | 2 | 4 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Buffer 20% |

## Critical Path Summary
- List the stages on the critical path once dependencies and dates are finalized.

## Overall Duration
- Total base duration: 88 days
- Total buffer: 23 days
- Total duration (base + buffer): 111 days

## Date Baseline
- Project start: TBD
- Project end: TBD
