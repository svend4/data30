# Project Timeline

> Fill in the duration estimates (in working days), risk criticality, and baseline start date.
> The schedule fields will then be calculated accordingly.

## Assumptions
- Working calendar: 5-day work week.
- Buffers are added to each stage as a separate line item (not merged into the base estimate).
- Dates should be adjusted after approvals/inputs are available.

## Stage Plan

| Stage | Base estimate (days) | Risk criticality (Low/Med/High) | Risk buffer (days) | Dependencies | Critical path | Start date | End date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Discovery & scope | TBD | TBD | TBD | None | Yes | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2. Requirements & solution design | TBD | TBD | TBD | 1 | Yes | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 3. Implementation | TBD | TBD | TBD | 2 | Yes | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 4. QA & validation | TBD | TBD | TBD | 3 | Yes | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 5. Release & handover | TBD | TBD | TBD | 4 | Yes | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Critical Path Summary
- Discovery & scope → Requirements & solution design → Implementation → QA & validation → Release & handover.

## Overall Duration
- Total base duration: TBD days
- Total buffer: TBD days
- Total duration (base + buffer): TBD days

## Date Baseline
- Project start: TBD
- Project end: TBD
