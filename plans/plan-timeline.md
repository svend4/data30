# Project Timeline

> Fill in the duration estimates (in working days), risk criticality, and baseline start date.
> The schedule fields will then be calculated accordingly.

## Assumptions
- Working calendar: 5-day work week.
- Buffers are added to each stage as a separate line item (not merged into the base estimate).
- Dates should be adjusted after approvals/inputs are available.

## Stage Plan

| Stage | Base estimate (days) | Risk criticality (Low/Med/High) | Risk buffer (days) | Dependencies | Critical path | Start date | End date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Discovery & scope | 5 | Med | 2 | None | Yes | 2025-01-06 | 2025-01-10 | Stakeholder alignment and scope confirmation |
| 2. Requirements & solution design | 7 | Med | 2 | 1 | Yes | 2025-01-13 | 2025-01-21 | Requirements workshops and solution blueprint |
| 3. Implementation | 15 | High | 5 | 2 | Yes | 2025-01-22 | 2025-02-11 | Build, integration, and internal reviews |
| 4. QA & validation | 8 | Med | 3 | 3 | Yes | 2025-02-12 | 2025-02-21 | Test execution and defect remediation |
| 5. Release & handover | 3 | Low | 1 | 4 | Yes | 2025-02-24 | 2025-02-26 | Release readiness and handover session |

## Critical Path Summary
- Stages 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 form the critical path based on sequential dependencies.

## Overall Duration
- Total base duration: 38 days
- Total buffer: 13 days
- Total duration (base + buffer): 51 days

## Date Baseline
- Project start: 2025-01-06
- Project end: 2025-02-26
